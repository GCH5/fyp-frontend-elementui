      Queue analysis is the study of a queue. There are two essential characteristics of a queue, the current waiting time of a queue, and the queue length. To analyze a queue, the observer needs to track every person in the queue, to record their position and waiting time. Recent developments in Computer Vision and Deep Learning makes it possible to perform queue analysis, and all it costs is simply a surveillance camera. With queue analysis, the true status of a queue could be visually revealed for store owners, station managers, and event organizers, which could help them make more statistically sensible choices, and allocate resources more appropriately.

      Our project has two main contributions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A robust queue analysis algorithm designed for single-viewed surveillance camera
      </li>
      <li>
        A user-friendly web application with the corresponding API server, which the user could easily interacted with to perform the queue analysis and get the analysis results
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The algorithm and server part of our system are developed with Python, and the web application part developed with JavaScript. Linting, code commit styles, and automatic testing were introduced throughout the project to enhance the code quality. User-acceptance tests have been conducted to ensure our application is understandable by common people.
