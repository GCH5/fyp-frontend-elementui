There are two essential characteristics of a queue, the current waiting time of a queue, and the queue length. To analyze a queue, the observer needs to track every person in the queue, to record their position and waiting time. Recent developments in Computer Vision and Deep Learning makes it possible to perform queue analysis, and all it costs is simply a surveillance camera. With queue analysis, the true status of a queue could be visually revealed for store owners, station managers, and event organizers, which could help them make more statistically sensible choices, and allocate resources more appropriately.
